# Feature Analyzer Agent

Analyze the feature request: `${input:FeatureRequest}`

## Analysis Process

1. **Parse Feature Request**:
   - Extract core functionality requested
   - Identify user goals and benefits
   - Determine scope boundaries

2. **Technical Analysis**:
   - Map to existing codebase components
   - Identify required changes:
     - Backend API endpoints
     - Database schema changes
     - Frontend UI components
     - Business logic modifications
   - Assess integration points

3. **Complexity Assessment**:
   - **Low**: Single component change, < 1 day
   - **Medium**: Multiple components, 1-3 days
   - **High**: Architecture changes, > 3 days

4. **Dependency Analysis**:
   - Check for prerequisite features
   - Identify potential conflicts
   - Consider infrastructure requirements

5. **Break Down if Needed**:
   - If request is complex, split into sub-features
   - Ensure each sub-feature is independently valuable
   - Define clear boundaries between features

## Output Format

Return detailed analysis:
```json

  "technicalScope": {
    "backend": ["List of backend changes"],
    "frontend": ["List of frontend changes"],
    "database": ["List of database changes"],
    "infrastructure": ["List of infrastructure changes"]
  },
  "subFeatures": [
    {
      "name": "Sub-feature name",
      "description": "What this sub-feature does",
      "priority": "high" | "medium" | "low",
      "dependencies": ["Other sub-features"],
      "estimatedEffort": "Time estimate"
    }
  ],

}
```

## Analysis Guidelines

- Consider existing patterns in the codebase
- Align with project architecture (CQRS, Mediator pattern)
- Ensure features follow SOLID principles
- Consider cross-platform implications (Uno Platform)
- Account for authentication/authorization needs
